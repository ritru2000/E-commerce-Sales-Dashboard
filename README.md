2.Short Description / Purpose:
   This project focuses on analyzing E-commerce sales data to understand business performance and revenue drivers. The dataset contains   order date, product category, quantity, price, revenue, customer location, and payment methods. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard highlighting sales and profit , Total sales and profit by payment mode, sales by category and ship mode and segment  and regional performance. The insights help businesses improve profitability, optimize product offerings, and make data-driven decisions.

3. Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
1.Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
2.Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
3.DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
4.Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables  to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

4.Features / Highlights:
1.Business problem:
Business stakeholders are unable to analyze customer purchase patterns and regional sales variations, causing challenges in targeting the right customers and markets.

2. Goal of the dashboard:
   To monitor overall business performance through an interactive dashboard that highlights sales growth, category performance, and market demand.

     Conclusion:
The E-commerce Sales Dashboard successfully provides a centralized and real-time view of key sales KPIs, helping track performance across products, customers, and regions. Insights gained from the dashboard enable the business to improve profitability, boost customer satisfaction, and make data-driven strategic decisions. This project demonstrates the value of dashboards in modern retail business to monitor trends, identify opportunities, and optimize operations.
